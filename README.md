# MEng-Aerospace-Engineering-Dissertation-Project

A collection of MATLAB scripts created in 2019/20 and used for my dissertation project at the University of Nottingham. 
The project aim was to design a set of software tools that serve as a feasibility study for preliminary multi-planet space mission concepts. 
The project was successful and the paper I wrote summarising my work received a first class grade.
